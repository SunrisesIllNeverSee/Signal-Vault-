# Signal Compression System (SCS)

**SCS** is a spec-first module inside **SignalVault** for quantifying meaning-density in human–AI interaction.

## Why
Most analytics count **volume**.  
SCS measures **clarity under pressure**: how much meaning is compressed into tokens, prompts, and sessions.

## Public-Safe Features
- `SNR` — Signal-to-Noise Ratio
- `PromptComplexity` — structured intent density
- `SessionDepth` — sustained reasoning span
- `CrossThreadRefs` — integration across contexts
- `SigDriftPoints` — drift events detected
- `GhostTokens` — proxy for hidden token overhead
