# Signal Compression System (SCS)

**SCS** is a spec-first module inside **SignalVault** for quantifying meaning-density in humanâ€“AI interaction.

## Why
Most analytics count **volume**.  
SCS measures **clarity under pressure**: how much meaning is compressed into tokens, prompts, and sessions.

## Public-Safe Features
- `SNR` â€” Signal-to-Noise Ratio
- `PromptComplexity` â€” structured intent density
- `SessionDepth` â€” sustained reasoning span
- `CrossThreadRefs` â€” integration across contexts
- `SigDriftPoints` â€” drift events detected
- `GhostTokens` â€” proxy for hidden token overhead
