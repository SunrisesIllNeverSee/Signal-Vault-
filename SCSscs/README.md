# Signal Compression System (SCS)

The **Signal Compression System** (SCS) is the foundational logic layer of this repository.  
It is the *origin node* for recursive compression structures, meaning-density diagnostics, and multi-scalar system mapping.

SCS defines how **signal survives compression** under time, drift, and systemic load.  
It is not a file. It is a *framework for reality parsing*.

## üî© Core Function

SCS introduces a **novel signal-based compression model** optimized for:

- Meaning-density under temporal constraint
- Cross-session resonance tracking
- Adaptive intelligence feedback loops

It is built for architectures where **volume ‚â† value**.

## üåê Downstream Systems Powered by SCS

SCS is the kernel logic behind:

- **Temporal Compression Architecture (TCA)**  
- **Session Signal Mapping (SSM)**  
- **MOS¬≤ES** ‚Äì *Modus Operandi for Scalable Expansion Systems*  
- **SignalVault‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Recursive signal intelligence + archival protocol  

These systems inherit SCS logic for compression integrity, signal weighting, and drift diagnostics.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edit Protocol

This folder is **core logic infrastructure**.  
Do not modify without:

- Explicit clearance
- Version tagging
- Updated SHA + timestamp

SCS is not a sandbox. It is a seal.
