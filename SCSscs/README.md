## Signal Compression System (SCS)

The **Signal Compression System (SCS)** is the foundational logic layer of this repository.  
It represents a novel compression framework for understanding and quantifying high-density signal under temporal constraints.

SCS is the origin point for multiple downstream innovations including:
- Temporal Compression Architecture (TCA)
- Session Signal Mapping (SSM)
- The MOS²ES framework (Modus Operandi for Scalable Expansion Systems)
- SignalVault’s recursive design logic
