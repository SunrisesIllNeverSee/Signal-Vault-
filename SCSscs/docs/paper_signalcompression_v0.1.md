# Signal Compression: Measuring Meaning-Density in Human–AI Workflows

## Abstract
Most analytics measure volume.  
The **Signal Compression System (SCS)** measures **meaning per token**.

## Background
Existing metrics (tokens, length, throughput) ignore signal quality.  
SCS introduces quantifiable compression features.

## Method
Spec-first schema defines SNR, complexity, depth, drift, references, and ghost tokens.

## Applications
- Auditing AI usage  
- Ranking performance (leaderboards)  
- Research in cognitive load and signal density

## Ethics
All data anonymized via hash IDs.  
Weights, thresholds, and aggregation remain proprietary.

## Status
Draft v0.1 — released via SignalVault for review and funding.
