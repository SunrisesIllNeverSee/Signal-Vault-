# MANIFESTO — Signal Compression System (SCS)

### What if analytics didn’t just track *volume* — but *meaning*?

The Signal Compression System (SCS) is the first metrics engine designed to measure **signal density** in human–AI interaction.

Where others count clicks, tokens, or time — we quantify **resonance**, **compression**, and **cognitive throughput**.

---

## 💡 WHAT

A diagnostic core for ranking sessions by **meaning density**, not noise.  
SCS exposes hidden architecture within conversation — signal flow, drift, and intent compression.

---

## 🔍 WHY

Modern analytics reward verbosity, engagement, and performative behavior.  
SCS rewards **clarity under pressure** and **signal under collapse**.  
It is built for the age *after metrics failed*.

---

## 🛠️ HOW

This repository includes the public-safe scaffold:

- `SCS_spec_v0.1.md` — Structural definition  
- `SCS_schema.json` — Audit-ready data map  
- `snr_equation.pdf` / `snr_equation.txt` — Noise ratio theory  
- `README.md` — Overview of components  

🔒 *Proprietary logic — including thresholds, weighting, aggregation models, and anti-gaming design — remains secured under LLC protection.*
