## 🔍 Variable Definitions

| Symbol | Name                        | Description |
|--------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `TPW`  | Tokens Per Word             | Signal density baseline (efficiency of language) |
| `SNR`  | Signal-to-Noise Ratio       | Core clarity metric (0.0 – 1.0) |
| `PC`   | Prompt Complexity           | Depth of nested reasoning within prompt structure |
| `SDR`  | Session Drift Resistance    | Stability over time and span (context compression) |
| `GT`   | Ghost Tokens                | Hidden/overhead tokens (proxy for bloat or system inefficiency) |
| `SDP`  | Signal Drift Points         | Detected shifts, losses, or semantic fractures |

## 🧠 Interpretation Logic

- **Higher SCS scores** → indicate high signal integrity, conceptual density, and contextual endurance.
- **Negative components (GT, SDP)** → subtract from the signal value due to overhead or instability.
- **The system is recursive** → these values can evolve in real-time across a session.
