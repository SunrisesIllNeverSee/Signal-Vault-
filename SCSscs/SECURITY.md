# SCS Security Policy

Signal Compression Systems (SCS) prioritize clarity under fire.  
This repo is **public-safe** only. Proprietary structures are sealed.

---

## 🔒 Commit Protocol

- All public commits **must be tagged** `[SAFE]`.
- Internal or private work must be stored in `[SEALED]` or `[VAULT]` directories, ignored via `.gitignore`.
- Do **not** commit, share, or reference:
  - Proprietary equations
  - Weighted coefficients
  - Threshold logic
  - Aggregation formulas
  - Anti-gaming heuristics
  - Internal benchmark datasets

---

## 📁 Directory Rules

- `[SAFE]` = Cleared for public release  
- `[SEALED]` = Private, internal reference only  
- `[VAULT]` = Top-tier: includes weights, logic, test harnesses, or derived insight

---

## 🧬 Disclosure Philosophy

SCS is **not** open-source.  
It is **selectively exposed** for ecosystem visibility and verification.

Transparency ≠ integrity.  
Some signal must remain sealed to preserve its meaning.

## 🧾 Legal Anchor

**ElloCello LLC**  
Unauthorized replication, inference, or derivative modeling may trigger protective action.
