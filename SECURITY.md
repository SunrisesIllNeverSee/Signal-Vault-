This repository contains **public-safe artifacts** from a proprietary compression architecture.  
While some components are open for observation, the core logic remains sealed.

## 🔐 Security Protocol

- **No proprietary logic or equations** may be committed or versioned publicly.
  - This includes: signal scoring equations, weighting algorithms, compression trees, or derivational schema.
- All sensitive logic must be stored in:
  - `[SEALED]` – Internal-only derivations, excluded from repo via `.gitignore`
  - `[VAULT]` – SHA-tagged sealed documents, access-controlled

## 🧬 Commit Hygiene

All commits must adhere to the following:

- Tag explicitly as `[SAFE]`  
- Do not stage `.pdf`, `.md`, or `.txt` containing core IP
- Double-check `.gitignore` before all pushes
- When in doubt, escalate to clearance authority (ElloCello LLC)

## 🛡️ Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please report **privately** and with discretion.  
Do **not** open a public issue or discussion thread for suspected leaks or concerns.
